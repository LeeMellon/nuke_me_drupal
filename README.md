# Drupal Octane

A distribution of Drupal 8 maintained by Phase2.

Built using Acquia Lightning.

# Installing

Octane is no longer a Drupal profile. Sites are expected to create their own custom profile.
To create an Octane-based project use the Octane Project via composer:

```$xslt
composer create-project phase2/octane-project ProjectName

```
